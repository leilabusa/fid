<p>Not is our food good, it's also good-looking! Our patrons often stop to admire our fare with a quick Instagram before digging in. We've collected a few of our favorite shots here.</p>

<h2>Our Baked Goods</h2>
<p><a href="bread.html"><img src="thumbnails/bread-200.jpg" alt="close-up of sliced rustic bread" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
We start our day at the crack of dawn to bake our own muffins, bread, and dinner rolls. Loaves not used that day are donated to the local food shelter. </p>

<h2>Our Burgers</h2>
<p><a href="burgers.html"><img src="thumbnails/burgers-200.jpg" alt="close-up of cheeseburgers" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
People come from all over to enjoy our lovingly made burgers. We grind our own locally-sourced organic beef and turkey so you know it's fresh and free from fillers and other nonsense. Go for one of our creative topping combos or stick with the classics. </p>

<h2>Catch of the Day</h2>
<p><a href="fish.html"><img src="thumbnails/fish-200.jpg" alt="close-up of plated fish dish" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our chef works with local fisherman to pick the freshest the sea has to offer for our daily seafood special. Our Roast Cod Caponata with Roasted Potatoes is an old favorite with our regulars.</p>

<h2>Tasty Chicken</h2>
<p><a href="chicken.html"><img src="thumbnails/chicken-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fried chicken in baskets" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Our fried chicken is a family favorite. Locally-sourced and organic, we serve our chicken fresh with a variety of sauces.</p>

<h2>Golden French Fries</h2>
<p><a href="fries.html"><img src="thumbnails/fries-200.jpg" alt="close-up of fries with a container of ketchup" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
Try our crispy golden french fries cut from farm grown potatoes. We always make sure our fries are hot when they arrive at your table. As a side or on their own, they'll taste great with the sauce of your choice.</p>

<h2>Fresh Tabouleh</h2>
<p><a href="tabouleh.html"><img src="thumbnails/tabouleh-200.jpg" alt="close-up of tabouleh dish topped with mint leaves" width="200" height="200"></a><br>
If you ever need a refreshing bite to eat, our tabouleh is perfect. It's made from parsley, bulgur, and vegetables, and is served with dressing and a mint leaf garnish.</p>
